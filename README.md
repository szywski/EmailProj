# EmailProj


A program that can generate workers emails, and change passwords. 

Program works without database(I'll do it someday) so you can change password only during session.
Program merges name, last name, department(optional thing) and gives you address, and generates random password which you can immidiately change.

## TO DO
* Add database
* Add walidation of address (blank character, capitalleters etc.)
* Add password walidation
* Add functionality to print adequate data into file
